## Description
This project includes a Brick Breaker game implemented using both Unity and HTML/JavaScript Canvas. The game involves a paddle, ball, walls, and bricks. The objective is to break all the bricks on the screen using the ball and paddle mechanics.

### Key Differences Between Unity and HTML/JavaScript Canvas Implementations

#### Unity Implementation:
- Platform: Unity is a game development platform primarily used for creating 2D and 3D games.
- Components: Unity provides a rich ecosystem of components like rigid bodies, colliders, and physics engines built-in.
- Scripting: Unity uses C# or UnityScript (a variant of JavaScript) for scripting game logic.
- Scene Management: Unity offers a robust scene editor for designing levels and managing game objects.
- Graphics: Unity provides advanced rendering capabilities, including shaders and lighting effects.

#### HTML/JavaScript Canvas Implementation:
- Platform: Implemented using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- Canvas: Utilizes the HTML `<canvas>` element for rendering graphics.
- Graphics: Graphics are drawn directly onto the canvas using JavaScript, which offers flexibility but requires more manual handling for animations and interactions.
- Scripting: Uses JavaScript for game logic and event handling.
- Physics and Collisions: Involves manually implementing collision detection and response algorithms for game objects.
- Accessibility: Runs in web browsers, making it accessible across different platforms without requiring additional plugins.

## Features
- Interactive gameplay with paddle and ball mechanics.
- Score tracking.


## How to Play
1. Controls (Unity):
   - Use the mouse or arrow keys to move the paddle left and right.
 
   
2. Controls (HTML/JavaScript Canvas):
   - Use the mouse to move the paddle left and right.
 
   
3. Gameplay:
   - Break all the bricks by bouncing the ball off the paddle.
   - Avoid letting the ball fall off the bottom of the screen.
